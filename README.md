# Flosculus Roseus Dahlia
By definition, Mandala Art is a symbolic picture of the universe, the circle that represents wholeness, totality, infinity, timelessness, and unity. In this illustration, the piece includes four representations. First, is the pink dahlia, which is a flower that symbolizes self-love. Second, the squares stand for balance and stability as well as a sign of human effort versus natureâ€™s creations. Third, the triangles that define energy and enthusiasm that all deities have; are related to the number three, a symbol moving on the path to enlightenment from beginning to middle to end. Lastly, the color blue signifies religious feelings and the feminine energies of compassion and love. Blue is also associated with relaxation and calmness. Together, all of these representations are girdled by the circle, which unites everything in one piece.

I used functions, loops, and different math equations to come up with my Mandala Art.
